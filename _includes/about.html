I prefer non-conventional hiking to routine travel. I keep myself updated with the emerging trends in science and technology. I believe evolution is the most important phenomenon in the universe and the only meaningful things to do is to pursue answers to frontier questions in physics and congnition, everything else is utter stupidity and waste of time. I stay stupid for a major proportion of the time I'm awake. Education and world peace are some causes I believe in. People say I crave to win arguments but I just try to attain an equilibrium of opinion irrespective of who's side its nearer to. Having a stong criticism of contemporary events and not taking the slightest initiative I think is neccessary sounds very much like me. Terms like conspiracy nut have also been used to address me.</p></div><div class="skill-lock"></div></section>

I lay by the river which felt more like a streak surrounding a moat protected by unnecessarily huge walls of cliffs. The moon was  bright enough to illuminate the land but conveniently located on the far left of the sky above the steep edge of the hill leaving the larger part of the sky dark for the stars. Laying there I felt more alive than any time in the recent past.
I hear "Nikhil!" from far off the path filled with river bed rocks I had to take to reach here. Crossing those rocks is more fun than walking the edge of the footpath I do in campus and even running over the rail track.  It was Revanth. They had finally arrived.

After long talks, dancing and singing by the campfire everyone's now asleep. Not sure its the beauty of the sky or congestion in the tents we decided to sleep in the open and loaded the tents with our bags. 
 

Moon has now reached the zenith rendering most stars invisible. Funnily enough it now seems like a floodlight from above the walls of a fort searching for intruders. With moonlight  being enough for navigation, I moved a few yards away from the tents up the rocks.
 
Sitting by the river, I now see tranquil flow of the river, partially lit rockbed terrain and in between on the rocky sand bank, three tents, flames in the remains of campfire are still fighting to flourish oblivious of the existence of a  blizzard that is destined to perish them soon.
My thin half sleeve T-shirt doesnt leave me with any less than bitter shivering in the cold river breeze. The breeze creating some motion here and there around me saving me from loneliness with some ghostly presence.

I'm awed at the beauty of the scene as I keep scanning it continually. Sometimes the sky sometimes the rocks then the river then every other thing too. But the mere acknowledgement of my inability to capture this moment forever pushes me into a deep melancholia.
After all every thing cannot be captured.
